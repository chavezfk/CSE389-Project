			We used an API for the text editor. It is an open source javascript program called Ace. It is used by many online code editing websites such as Github, CodeAcademy, Khan Academy, CodeMonkey, and a significant number of other websites. The link to their website can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://ace.c9.io/"> here</a>.<br><br>
