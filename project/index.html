			The NMT Gym hosts several sports events every semester. Once of these is the intramural sports. The intramural sports are a chance for students to participate in indoor soccer, outdoor soccer, basketball, indoor volleyball, outdoor volleyball, and softball. The purpose of this project is to streamline the process of the documentation involved in creating and managing the intramural tournaments. It also makes communication between the different parties involved easier for everyone.
