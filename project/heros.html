			<p>Below is some information about the contributers to this project.</p>
			
			<h3>Franz Chavez</h3>
			<p><div class="imgborder"><img class="img" src="img_franz.jpg" alt="Picture"/></div>
			Franz worked on each visible webpage: home, create, join, and the editor.
			He worked on the connections between each page, along with the interactions between the client and the server
			in terms of session creation. 
			The general process is that the home page will direct to either create or join, then that page will
			gather the needed information, be it creating a session or joining one, and send the required session and user
			information to the editor for use in the collaborative process.<br><br>
 
			Franz also worked on the project website available <a href="index.html" > here</a>.<br><br>

			He assisted the other members during the design of the website's visual appeal. 
			He worked in small amounts on other parts of the project too such as the editor and the servelet development,
			along with some minor to major bug fixes that were required throughout the development process. <br><br>
			If interested, his personal website and CV can be found <a href="https://www.cs.nmt.edu/~fchave00/">here</a>.
